cd .g## About Me

Sometimes I have things to say; you can find my assorted ramblings for your reading pleasure [here](https://quotidian-ennui.github.io).

I have excellent knowledge of many different technology stacks, and can recognise potential weaknesses and design effective solutions. I understand the interplay between new features, system complexity, and technical debt, and can make trade-offs among them effectively to deliver the solution you need.
